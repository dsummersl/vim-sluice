Sluice
====

The sluice plugin uses vim's '+signs' gutter to show what lines match your current
searches at a high level.

Plugins exist for:

    * search (/)
    * matches for the current word under the cursor.
    * git changes

Testing
====

To run the unit tests you must install the vimunit plugin
(https://github.com/dsummersl/vimunit).

~/.vim/bundle/vimunit/vutest.sh autoload/mvom/test.vim
