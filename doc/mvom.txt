ABOUT                                              *mvom-about*

Plugins                                            *mvom-plugins*

Data Sources                                       *mvom-data-sources*

Given all the plugins, generate the line level data: which plugins have
matches on which lines. Format is:
{
	'<linenumber>': {
		'count': number of matches on the line
		'plugins': an array with the name of the 'Data' plugins that have
		matches on this particular line.
		'line': line number
		'text': text to display in signs area
    'fg': foreground
    'bg': background
		TODO linehi - hilighting for the linelevel option.
	}
}

Renderers                                          *mvom-renderers*

Actual logic that paints the matches. Painting and searching are abstracted
out so that it can be tested by itself.

Parameters: searchResults are of the form defined by CombineData.

Return: dictionary of lines that are currently set. Each line contains the
standard elements created by CombineData. Additional possible keys:

'visible'  - if the line is currently displayed on the screen then this would
             be set to '1'.
'metaline' - when in 'meta' mode this is the line that represents the %
             offset of the actual line.

Also makes some global variables for all the hilighting options that have
possibly been created (so that they don't have to be recreated). These are
created before the paintFunction is called, so that the paintFunction
doesn't actually have to create any hilighting itself.
