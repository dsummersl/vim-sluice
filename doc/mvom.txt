" Builtin data sources {{{
" The basic idea for this is that there are X plugins supported and each
" plugin is expected to have specific function names:
"
" <plugin>Init() -- called the first time its used
" <plugin>Enabled() -- called on repaints... 1 for true, 0 for false.
" <plugin>#Data(): return data. 
" Each data uses a 'num'(row number) as key and then the following:
" {
" 	'count': number of occurrances on this line
" }
" Note: you can move the cursor around as much as you want as the position has
" been saved and will be restored after this method call.

" }}}

Renderers                                          *mvom-renderers*

" Builtin rendering types {{{
" The rendering types are pluggable. Here is the expected format for them:
" <render>Init() -- init anything it needs to init.
" <render>PaintMacro() -- return a dictionary telling what symbols to place
" in macro mode.
" Should have the following keys for each line:
" {
"   'text':  -- 2 symbols to display if there is a match
"   'fg': -- foreground
"   'bg': -- background
"   'linehi': -- highlight for the group. Probably not meaningful for macro mode...
" }
" <render>Paint(vals) -- return a dictionary telling what symbols to place
" in micro mode.
" vals param has the following keys:
" {
" 	'count': --- number of ... whatever... matches, links, etc
" 	'line': --- line of concern
" }
" Should have the following keys:
" {
"   'text':  -- (optional) 2 symbols to display if there is a match
"   'fg': -- foreground
"   'bg': -- background
"   'linehi': -- highlight for the group
" }
"
