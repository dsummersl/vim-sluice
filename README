A plugin for vim that shows you where other matches to your current regular
expression are.

To use:

put the vim file in your ~/.vim/plugins folder.

:set hls

/searchforsomething/

================================================================================

TODO:

- Support terminal vim (automatically pick colors available rather than assuming full GUI colors are there)
- optimizations, I suspect.
- add script requirements for vim 7.2 and +float.
- support the 'resolved' feature (two or more plugins highlighting the same lines).
